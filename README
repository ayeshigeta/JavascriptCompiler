SourceMap enables you to map a minified file back to its source.

I found this article very helpful to understand sourcemaps 
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/

Running the java main will minify and generate sourcemap for jquery.js source.

How to test SourceMap in Chrome.
1. Open chrome and from Dev tools > General > Settings check "Enable Source Maps".
2. Navigate to index.html in chrome browser.
3. put a break point in index.html click handler and step into jQuery source(not the minified version).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can generate minified javascript and sourcemap using a commandline option.

Run the following from JacascriptCompiler directory

java -jar lib/compiler.jar --compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS --js js/jquery.js --js_output_file js/min/jquery.js --create_source_map js/min/jquery.js.map --source_map_format V3

1. Edit minified source(/js/min/jquery.js) to add the sourcemap url(without the quote)
"//@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.js.map"
The compiler doesn't automatically add the source map location to the minified file.

2. I couldn't find a command line option manipulate the sourcemap relative path to the source file.
You can accomplish that by adding "sourceRoot" or Change "sources" from ["js/jquery.js"] to ["../jquery.js"]

Now follow the above step to test sourcemapping.
